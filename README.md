It is a website which is focussed on providing home repair services by technicians (are those who will get jobs). On landing on our homepage you can see our advertising and the different services available on our website. At the top right corner there are log in and register options. While registering yourself you have to specify yourself as an Employer or an Employee.
On registering as employer(customer) you see a dashboard listing all repair services. On registering as employee he sees the works assigned to him. He can choose to accept or deny the repair work assigned to him.
So there are two types of people employer and employee. Employer post gigs(repair works to be done) and then the system automatically assigns those gigs to employees who are in the area where repairs are to be done. 
This site uses Django and Python at backend and uses vanilla js at front end along with html, css and bootstrap.
Due to this Covid-19 pandemic lots of migrant labourers and workers have lost their jobs. So they can register themselves in this site and can get to work and get paid without searching for jobs. So it solves the given problem statement.

Prompts 1 and 2 have been implemented.
